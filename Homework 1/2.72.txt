A. 
since the sizeof operator returns a value of type size_t is unsigned int, and the maxbytes is signed int, the maxbytes will implicitly cast to a unsigned int in order to do the subtraction. Thus the result of the subtraction will always between 0 and a positive number, which the conditional test will always works in this function.
B.
Since the result is always unsigned int, in order to make it work properly 
void copy_int(int val, void *buf, int maxbytes)
{
	if(maxbytes-ï¼ˆint)sizeof(val)>=0)
	{
	   memcpy(buf, (void*) &val, sizeof(val));
	   }
}
